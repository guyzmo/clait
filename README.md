# Clait

A tool to generate nicely formatted and LaTeX generated invoices.

## How to install?

just run:

    python3 setup.py install

## How to develop?

    pip3 install zc.buildout
    buildout

you'll find the tool in:

    bin/clait

## External dependency

you need to make sure you have installed the texlive suite, along with
the `pdflatex` tool. No special LaTeX library is needed.

## How to use?

create a directory such as `paperwork`, within it create two files:

`invoices_config.yaml`:

that will contain the name of the template (`format` key) the path to the pdflatex tool,
and in `source` all the custom information for your billing.

```

  invoice: FA

```

`invoices_list.yaml`:

that will contain a list of `!invoice` objects. The `iid` will be the unique reference
of the invoice. Then all the elements are as defined by the template.


```
- !invoice
  iid: 201410-001

```

## How to run?

To generate all your invoices, in the `paperwork` directory:

    clait -d paperwork generate

If you want your tax calculation:

    clait -d paperwork results quarterly
    clait -d paperwork results yearly

And finally, to launch the webapp, use

    clait -d paperwork api

If you've made a change to an invoice and need to regenerate, just remove
the pdf file!


## How will it look like?
